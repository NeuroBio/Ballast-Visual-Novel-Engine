# Visual-Novel-Engine
What it says on the tin.  I'm building out my own engine so I can add more complex mechanics to it while still keeping the codebase light and fast.
This part of the project is JUST the story engine.  Eventually, there will be a separate repo for UI logic in javascript and maybe one more for a fully implemented UI.  That last bit may only exist in my own fullly fleshed out story project.  Not sure yet.
